* WITH A UNIQUE UI, NOT ANY EXISTING UI


* A FEATURE TO ADD NICKNAMES


* THERE SHOULD BE A FEATURE TO SEND PHOTOS, VIDEOS, PDFS, ETC.


* IT IS GOING TO BE A WEBAPP AND SHOULD BE COMPACTABLE FOR ALL KINDS OF DEVICES


* THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR VOICE CALLS, VIDEO CALLS, ETC. IT IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON TEXT MESSAGES


* A SIGNUP PAGE WHERE A USER CAN CREATE AN ACCOUNT BUT ONLY WITH THE PERMISSION FROM THE 3 ADMINS VISULAISE THIS IN THE SIGNUP PAGE WHERE THE PENDING REQUEST ACCESS FROM THE 3 THE PAGE SHOULD ALSO SHOW WHICH OF THE ADMIN HAS GIVEN ACCESS THE 3 ADMINS NAMED as SIGMA ALPHA SATPURA
